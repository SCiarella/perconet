rewrite rows_uniq_elems and fix the way it is called (why not 1 np.unique call???)
test data has 1-based node numbers but class assumes 0-based. Seems to work fine because node 0 simply doesn't get used. check.
bond data in class remains 0-based in this test data (check)
more clarifications of variable names
more docstrings
check if Ncolors in cluster_find can indeed be simplified ("THESE SHOULD BE...")
